We implemented the solution for email tracking but are now leveraging it to track incoming invoices as well. If a business is facing similar problems to ours in terms of tracking incoming emails or a high number of incoming emails from the same customers or suppliers, in my opinion HappyFox really is the best solution to resolve this. With HappyFox, you really are able to track everything that is coming in, and analyze the data in real-time.”",

We enter tickets and complete them daily and HappyFox has improved our average number of tickets completed per month. My customers (Health Center Staff) have all responded very positively to the change; they love that they can see all the tickets for their site and comment on whether they’re still needed.”",
